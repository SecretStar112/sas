# SAS
This is the collection of my own SAS utility macros/ sample code over my 10 years of SAS programming and analysis experience from 2004 to 2014.

I will try to organize my code/macros, mostly for analytic works, by functionality and area. Please note that all code is provided as it is. I don't have access to SAS now and I can't test any changes or provide support to make the code workable to SAS new versions.
